## 🧰 HTML and CSS Exercise

https://glaubercarlos.github.io/Exercises-HTML-CSS/

🚀 I am currently studying Fullstack Development, and this project is my first hands-on exercise focused on practicing HTML and CSS fundamentals.

ℹ️ I used flexbox, positioning, hover effects, and other basic CSS properties.

ℹ️ This site is responsive for 1920px and larger screens, and it adapts well to 1280px. It also includes a media query specifically designed for 480px devices.
